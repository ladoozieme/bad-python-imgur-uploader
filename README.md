#My bad python uploader
##Use at your own risk

This project is just for me to get familiar with the imgur api, python package distribution and git/github.

The code for the upload function was mostly taken from this [tutorial](http://blog.tankorsmash.com/?p=249). All I did was move it to a function and ad the commandline interface so it was easier to use.

Anyway if you actually want to use the program you'll need to get your own api key, details for that can be found at [http://api.imgur.com/](http://api.imgur.com/)
After you have obtained the api key find the line in uploadToImgur.py that looks like `KEY = None` and replace it with `KEY = "api_key_goes_here"`
