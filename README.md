#My bad python uploader
##use at your own risk

This project is just for me to get familiar with the imgur api, python package distribution and git/github.
The code for the upload() function is mostly taken from a tutorial I found on the internet, I can't remember where I saw it though...
Anyway if you actually want to use the program you'll need to get your own api key, details for that can be found at [http://api.imgur.com/](http://api.imgur.com/)
After you have obtained the api key find the line in uploadToImgur.py that looks like `KEY = None` and replace it with `KEY = "api_key_goes_here"`
