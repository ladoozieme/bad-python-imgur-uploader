This project is just for me to get familiar with the imgur api, python package distribution and git/github.
The code for the upload() function is mostly taken from a tutorial I found on the internet, I can't remember where I saw it though...
Anyway if you actually want to use the program you'll need to get your own api key, details for that can be found at http://api.imgur.com/
After you have the API key edit the file itself and replace whatever KEY is with KEY = "you_imgur_api_key"
